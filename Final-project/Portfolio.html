    <div style="position:absolute; left:500px; top:300px;">
    <p> With the wedding planner I developed you won't have to stress about how to evenly distribute your attendees at your special day! Just type how many people are attending following with how many tables you would like, and just like that all of your attendees have a table to sit at. Now you won't have to worry about not having enough tables during your special day. </p>
